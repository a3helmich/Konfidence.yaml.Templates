Some yml templates I use on my azure devops server. Needed by some published projects. Keep in mind that currently you cannot reference github from azure devops <ins>server</ins>. Templates need to be in the same organisation when used by pipelines on devops server.

<h6>GenerateAndPublishCodeCoverage.yml</h6> 

- requires the reportgenerator package 'dotnet tool update -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool'. Which should be run at some point in time before the unit tests are executed.
- tests should be run like 'dotnet test -c $(BuildConfiguration) --no-build  /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=cobertura'.
- the testprojects should contain the 'coverlet.msbuild' package.
